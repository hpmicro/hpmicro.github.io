# BLDC Trapezoidal Wave Control
## Overview

**Bldc_block** project demonstrates speed control of the BLDC.
- Control by trapezoidal wave algorithm

## Configurations

- This program uses the **BLM57050-1000** brushless motor of "Leisai Intelligence", refer to the [Leisai Intelligence](https://leisai.com/) website for the specific parameters of the motor.

- Board settings refer to the development board documentation [ PWM_PIN ](lab_board_motor_ctrl_pin) related content

- Click [HPM6750EVKMINI-TO-MOTOR Extension Board ](lab_board_hpm6750evkmini-to-motor-220530RevA) section and configure, list of supported development boards:
  - hpm6750evkmini
- Click [DRV-LV50A-MP1907 Motor Driver Board ](lab_drv_lv50a_mp1907) section and configure, list of supported development boards:
  - hpm6750evk

## Running the Demo

The motor runs at a speed of 20r/s.
The following data can be configured by serial console ï¼š

``speed`` float, range +40~-40, unit r/s.

The serial console message is as follows:

```
Mode selection:
0. Location mode.
1. Speed mode.
Enter mode code:
