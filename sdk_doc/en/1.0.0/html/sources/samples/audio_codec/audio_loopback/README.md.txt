# Audio Codec Loopback
## Overview

The audio_codec example shows how to use codec component to record and play audio information.
In this example, codec component records the sound and sents out encoded data by I2S interface,
MCU send back the received data to codec component, then codec component decodes and plays the audio data.

## Project Configuration

- In the file [cmakelists.txt](./CmakeLists.txt), set a matched audio codec type according to the development board schematicï¼Œe.g. "set(CONFIG_CODEC "sgtl5000")"

## Board Setting

1. Connect audio player to the [audio input](lab_board_app_audio_input) interface on the audio codec chip
2. Connect headphone to the [headphone](lab_board_app_headphone) interface on the audio codec chip

## Running the example

When the example runs successfully, the headphone will play the sound and the following message is displayed in the terminal:
```
